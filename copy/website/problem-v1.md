Title: "Most teams know AI matters, but they're not getting the most out of it."

Subtitle: "Tooling and policy are in place. Even so, adoption often stalls and feels underwhelming vs the '10x' hype."

## Problem 1: Early experiences underwhelm vs hype

- Many have tried LLMs and been underwhelmed vs the "10x" hype.
- Early experiments feel incremental, not transformational, so the story doesn’t match the marketing.
- That creates quiet skepticism and a sense that "this is oversold" or "it doesn’t really change my work yet."

## Problem 2: Context-reset fatigue makes serious use feel too costly

- To do anything meaningful, people have to rebuild context every time.
- They re-explain role, domain, constraints, examples, or scroll through messy old threads trying to find it again.
- That repeated setup is cognitively tiring and feels like wasted effort, so deeper, ROI-driving workflows never become habit.

## Problem 3: No time/space to build intuition with a non-deterministic tool

- Ops people already run 40–60+ hour weeks in constant execution mode.
- Real GenAI skill comes from intuition-building with a non-deterministic tool: trying prompts, comparing outputs, tuning instructions.
- That exploration always loses to urgent work, so “trying to keep up” feels stressful rather than empowering.
- Self-guided, off-the-shelf training is often gimmicky or generic, so even when teams invest, it rarely changes day-to-day behavior.
