Title: "What leaders say"

## Dekyi / Netflix testimonial

Hear it from Dekyi (my former fearless leader) at Netflix:

"He was pivotal in helping our cross functional team in EMEA on the road towards understanding the fundamentals of AI and highlighting the broad and various opportunities we have to very tactically incorporate AI in our workstreams to optimize our output in a variety of ways - going beyond just automation and leaning into creative ways to empower our teams and strengthen our impact. Can't recommend him highly enough."
